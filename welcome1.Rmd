## **Plot**

This section works with a dispersion diagram of the iris dataset, there are three options to this section,

* Change the name of the plot.
* Change de color of the plot.
* Change the size of the plot.

  **Instructions**:

* To change the name of the plot it is necessary to say the key word "title" and then say the name that we want.

* To change the color of the plot it is necessary to say the key word "color" an then say the color that we want.

* To change the size of the points in the dispersion diagram it is necessary to say "bigger" if we want to increse the size of the points, on the contrary say "samller" if we want to decrease the size of the points.
